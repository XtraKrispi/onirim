# Onirim
[Onirim](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71836/onirim) is a solo board game
with simple rules. I'm using the rules [here](https://images.zmangames.com/filer_public/fd/0e/fd0ef6a2-c019-47a2-910a-a556f03a3d02/zm4900_onirim_rules.pdf)

This is an implementation using the [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) programming language.

To get up and running, `npm install` and `npm start` is all that is needed to
start a dev server with the game running at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)

If you want to hack on this, Elm and elm-format will get installed with the `npm install`, and I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Elm plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elmtooling.elm-ls-vscode), which should be all you need.
